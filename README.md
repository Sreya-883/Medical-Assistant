# MediConnect - Healthcare Recommendation System

MediConnect is a healthcare recommendation system developed for the Girl Hackathon 2024. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to recommend suitable doctors based on user-entered symptoms.

## Project Overview

- **Symptom Analysis**: Users can input their symptoms through a web interface.
- **Doctor Recommendation**: Based on the entered symptoms, the system recommends doctors with relevant specialties and availability.
- **Machine Learning Model**: The system employs a machine learning model trained on historical symptom-doctor relationships to make accurate recommendations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: MediConnect provides a simple and intuitive web interface for symptom input and doctor recommendations.
